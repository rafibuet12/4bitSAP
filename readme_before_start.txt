##This is a project made for CSE,BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology) under the CSE404 course of DSD (Digital System Design).
Under this course, we had to make a 4bit SAP(Simple As POssible) microprocessor.

##This is a full functional Simulation file for the given instruction set. (Only the HLT instruction is not implemented. The rest is just fine. There is no confusion in this.)

##Before starting to anticipate, kindly read the "4bit PC Report.pdf" and "T-state_SAP" made for this in the "REPORT" folder.


If any confusion, mail me: rafi.buet12@gmail.com
